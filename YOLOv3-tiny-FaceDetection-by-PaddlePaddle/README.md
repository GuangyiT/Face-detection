YOLOv3-tiny-FaceDetection-by-PaddlePaddle
===
The code is based on https://github.com/wudejian789/YOLOv3-tiny-FaceDetection-by-PaddlePaddle which was for detection of images. I've transformed it into a version of detection of videos.

```
The model is trained on WIDER train data and score ***mAP = 0.779*** on WIDER val data.  
```
>***modelPath*** is your model path;  
>***USE_CUDA*** is whether to use GPU;
