#Face Recognition in real time comparing Haar Cacade, YOLOv3#

In this project, we test and compare different face detection algorithms on images and videos in several resolution formats.  

##Haar Cascade##

Haar feature-based cascade classifier is an Adaboost based approach where a cascade function is trained to detect objects in images. OpenCV2 contains a pretrained model for frontal face detection. The model files is stored in *haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml*

##YoloFace##

The YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, performant, real-time object detection algorithm based on CNN. The published model recognizes 80 different objects in images and videos. The model can be adapted to detect specifically human face. The implementation is based on the work by sthanhng [GitHub link](https://github.com/sthanhng/yoloface)
